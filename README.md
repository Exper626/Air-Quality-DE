# Air-Quality-DE
Ever wondered what you're really breathing? If you think it's only Oxygen sorry to burst your pre school thinking bubble. There is a lot of gases including **Formaldehyde**, a hidden threat in air pollution.
Formaldehyde, the simplest aldehyde to exist, is considered one of the useful compounds in industrial and organic chemistry. But what if this simple aldehyde accumulates in the troposphere? More than the atmosphere should hold? This gas can be released into the environment either through various natural processes like organic matter decomposition or human made processes. Recent centuries have recorded high emissions of harmful gases to the atmosphere due to extreme human activities performed with less regulations and no concerns shown at all. Mostly due to fossil fuel (non-renewable energy sources) consumption through combustion.
Formaldehyde accumulation in the atmosphere results in exposure to the general public and the environment, hence causing negative effects on human health and the environment. Do external factors influence atmospheric air pollutants? How does climate, temperature, geography, and global pandemic influence the tropospheric volatile organic compounds present in the atmosphere?
The project tackles this challenge by harnessing the power of Machine Learning, specifically time series analysis. Analyzing data to understand formaldehyde trends, predict air quality fluctuations, and ultimately, empower us to breathe cleaner air.
